  "1-COLLECTOR_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER": "Oh, what have we here? That’s a Pokédex!<NL>It records Pokémon data upon sight? I’ve never<NL>seen one before!<NL>I heard you can move the sun or moon icon to<NL>check the Pokémon habitat map by time of day!",
  "1-COLLECTOR_07_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START": "I take down details in my notebook about<NL>Pokémon I’ve battled.<NL>I’ll write more data down about your Pokémon!",
